# Intro To Coding For Journalists

This repository will hold a growing collection of resources and links to repositories to support a semester-long college level course aimed at journalists who want to learn coding skills.

## Coding For Journalists: A Course Outline

### Week One: Why Code?/The Development Environment

We address the basic questions of 'why code' -- which go far beyond 'it will get me a job.' Accountability in our increasingly high-tech world requires more of us as journalists -- we want to have a working knowledge of the technologies that have an impact on public policy and the lives of individuals.

We introduce the idea of a 'development environment' -- the integrated suite of tools used by newsroom developers to create projects. Each student leaves with a working set of tools.

Weekly presentation: Each week a student or pair of students should select and be prepared to discuss a news app or data visualization.

Fork and clone our class repository, add your name and a link to a project or your website on the students.md file, commit your changes, push them, and make a pull request. Due by Week 3 class.<br>

### Week Three: Bootstrap and Flat File Websites

We use Bootstrap -- a template language developed by Twitter -- to create a template for a simple flat-file website, which we store and host on Github.

*Week Three Readings*<br>

*Week Three Assignment*<Br>
Fork and clone the Flat File Site repository, change the title and add links, content and images to make a bare-bones portfolio site. Commit changes and push frequently. When you are ready, post the link to the Github Pages version of your site to our class Slack workspace in the #assignments channel. Due by Week Four class time; you will show your work at the beginning of class.

### Week Four: Javascript: The D3.js Library Introduction

We introduce Javascript concepts and begin using D3.js, a library created by Mike Bostock to do election data visualizations for the New York Times. D3.js has now become the dominant web-ready data visualization library. We also do a 'tour' of state of the art data visualizations from newsrooms.

*Week Four Readings*<br>
Interactive Data Visualization for the Web, Chapters 4 & 5<br>
[Data Journalism Must Live Up To Its Own Standards](http://www.niemanlab.org/2014/07/alberto-cairo-data-journalism-needs-to-up-its-own-standards/), Alberto Cairo, NiemanLab

*Week Four Diagnostic*<br>
You will have a diagnostic on the portions of Javascript covered in Chapters 3 & 4.


### Week Five: Javascript: Using D3.js To Build Data Visualizations

We build a simple Javascript data visualization using D3.js.

*Week Five Readings*<br>
Interactive Data Visualization for the Web, Chapters 6-8

*Week Five Diagnostic*<br>
You will have a diagnostic on Chapters 6-8 of Interactive Data Visualization for the Web.<br>

*Week Five Assignment*<br>
Fork and clone the D3http repository, and follow the instructions to make a simple scatterplot. Connect the scatterplot to a new datasource as noted in the instructions. Push to Github Pages and drop a link to your work in the #assignments channel of the class Slack workspace.

### Week Six: Serving Data Visualizations to the Web

We will use the simple flat-file website we built in Week Three to 'host' our data visualization.  Reviews key development skills such as using a local webserver to test our work, and then 'pushing' it live to the web using version control tools.

*Week Six Readings*<br>
[Grunt.js Taskrunner: Getting Started](https://gruntjs.com/getting-started) Read this and install Grunt via npm. Be sure you can 'spin up' a local webserver in a directory on your own machine. <br>

*Week Six Assignment*<br>
Fork and clone the Project Template repository, `npm install` the components, and spin up a local webserver. View the index.html file. If you have an issue, remember to [read the guide on how to file an issue](https://github.com/fullstackjournalists/fullstackjournalists/blob/master/how-to-file-an-issue.md) and file an issue.<br>

### Week Seven: Javascript: More Complex Data Visualizations

We take the basic D3 skills we have learned and, like art students, 'copy' a data visualization done by The Washington Post, and push it live to our own websites.

We also preview an app template -- either The Washington Post's Kyt or the NPR App Template, which will be used for a group project.

### Week Eight: Project Planning & Collaboration

Practicing all of these skills in a real newsroom environment means having excellent project management and collaboration skills. We learn basic aspects of the Agile tech project management methodology, learn how to build and manage a project card board, and practice splitting up projects, doing tasks, and merging and launching code when it's from multiple team members. Students pitch a team project.

### Week Nine: News App Frameworks/News App Templates

We will get a basic web app running during this class using an app template created for use in a newsroom environment (NYT's Kyt, or the NPR App Template). We'll use a simple list-search-sort app using data on police shootings.

### Week Eleven and Twelve: News App Project Workshop

Students will work together in teams and address issues they have encountered with their projects.
